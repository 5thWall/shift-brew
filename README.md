# shift-brew

Spokesman voice: When you are doing a bus you need to make sure that your Shifts are filled to perfection. Use `LEFT ARROW` and `RIGHT ARROW` to make a selection and `SPACE BAR` will fill the mug with goodies. Match the brew lines for dollars and try to bus forever. You can try but compound interest will make you stop. Works for Apple Silicon because that is all I have. But if you make friends with Janet she will make it run on your machine. Stay hydrated!

Note: compound interest and scoring not implemented yet.
